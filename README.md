## High Stakes


## Over Under:
The following is solely regarding V5RC Over Under 2023-2024. Contributers: Arnav Jha, Anshul Raghav

User contributions:

Arnav Jha:
- 
- Made autonomous skills code that scored consistently well and improved over the course of the season
- Made elims offensive code, effectively picking up 6 triballs and scoring them
- Made offensive code, effectively picking up 5 triballs, scoring them, and then touching bar, reliably scoring most of the AWP
- Made elims defensive code, effectively sabotaging the opponents chances of scoring points during the autonomous period, putting our team at an advantage when it came to elimination matches
- Developed a reliable PID that would be used for the next 2 years, inspiration taken from 2775V's online youtube tutorials, and equipping it to match the new standards of the robot that would be used for competition, for both Over Under and High Stakes, this PID served as an extremely reliable method for driving and turning, proving to be both durable and precise

Anshul Raghav:
- 
- Made defensive code, reliably collecting AWPs every single run, putting our team at an advantage during matches with both consistency, effectivity, and preciseness
